<h1>TUS Tracker App</h1>

TUS is a medical specialization exam. This MERN stack app has been developed for people preparing for TUS to follow their working processes. Users can record their daily working time, between which hours they work and which subjects they study. They can view their working time with graphs and review their past work by visiting desired day from the calendar.
